		<text value="Question: I found a problem with the AutoTimer, can you fix it?
&#10;Answer: First try the AutoTimer version in a recent (experimental) Image to see if the problem was fixed. Then read the Help again and the upcoming FAQs to make sure that this is actually a problem and not expected behavior.
&#10;If you still think there is something wrong with the AutoTimer, please visit http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/board and post your problem there.

&#10;Answer: Check &quot;Search type&quot; and &quot;Search strictness&quot; for the given AutoTimer.
&#10;&#10;Q: The show I'm trying to record contains umlauts in its title. AutoTimer does not find it.

&#10;A: From the Overview press MENU and enter the &quot;Setup&quot;. In this screen disable &quot;Guess existing timer based on begin/end&quot;."/>

&#10;Answer: Try using the default skin and if it works ask the creator of your regular skin. If it still does not work your image might not provide the actual default skin so contact the creator of your image."/>
